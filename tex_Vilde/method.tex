In this project we tried out many new concepts in our algorithm. We used Monte Carlo method. 


\subsection{Monte Carlo cycles}

In Monte Carlo methods, the goal is to 





\subsection{Metropolis algorithm}

\subsection{Random number generator}

\subsection{Parallelizing}

\subsection{Unit tests}

Check the L=2 result with the analytical one
 - We did it visually

Make a small matrix (ordered initial), calculate energy - flip one spin, calculate energy - is the change in energy what we expect? 

 - Should have had it underveis
 - Kan neste gang lage tester som gjør at når vi implementerer nye ting som for eksempel classes eller paralelleisering, vet at det ikke har skjedd noe galt.




Metropolis (T,A,...)
	Stochastic matrix  - convergences (forhold eigenvalue).
	
	Hvilken random number engine
	
MPI:	
	
- Develop codes locally, run with some few processes and test your codes. Do benchmarking, timing and so forth on local nodes, for example your laptop or PC.
- When you are convinced that your codes run correctly, you can start your production runs on available supercomputers.
	
	
MPI functions:
%
%MPI_InitMPI_Init - initiate an MPI computation
%
%MPI_FinalizeMPI_Finalize - terminate the MPI computation and clean up
%
%MPI_Comm_sizeMPI_Comm_size - how many processes participate in a given MPI communicator?
%
%MPI_Comm_rankMPI_Comm_rank - which one am I? (A number between 0 and size-1.)
%
%MPI_SendMPI_Send - send a message to a particular process within an MPI communicator
%
%MPI_RecvMPI_Recv - receive a message from a particular process within an MPI communicator
%
%MPI_reduceMPI_reduce or MPI_AllreduceMPI_Allreduce, send and receive messages
