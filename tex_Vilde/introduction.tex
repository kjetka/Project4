The aim of this project is to use a model of a magnetic material to explore different new aspects of programming. Among them are random number generators, the Monte Carlo method, the Metropolis algorithm and parallelizing. These are all important tools when programming physical systems.

We want to simulate a two dimensional ferromagnetic material using the Ising model. We are using Monte Carlo sampling with the Metropolis algorithm to find the steady state of the system at different temperatures and calculate the mean values of important properties of a magnetic material, the energy, the magnetic moment, the susceptibility and the heat capacity. Finally, we will use the results at different temperatures to find the critical temperature where the material has a phase transition from ferromagnetic with a spontaneous magnetic moment, to a paramagnet with zero magnetic moment.
