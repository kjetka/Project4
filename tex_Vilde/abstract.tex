In this project we used many different methods to model a two dimensional lattice using the Ising model. These methods were Monte Carlo sampling, the Metropolis algorithm, parallelizing and random number generators. Monte Caro methods can be used in many different and complicated physical problems. The Metropolis algorithm gives an easy shortcut because we only need a function that is proportional to the probability distribution function, we do not need to calculate the partition function.

We started with a small two dimensional lattice at one temperature, then increased the lattice size and calculated properties of a magnetic material for a temperature interval. We used the temperature dependence of the properties to evaluate the critical temperature and the second order phase transition.
