There are many physical problems that deals with differential equations. A simple example of this is the ordinary differential equations that governs how objects move in relations to each other, for example the solar system. The aim of this project is to model our solar system using a relatively simple model, relativistic model for the movement of the planets and the sun. In order to do this efficiently to different integration methods will be explored, the Euler method and the Velocity Verlet method. 


This report starts by the explaining basic theoretical physics that governs the movement of the objects in the solar system. These equations can be scaled and implemented in a general algorithm for solving 2. order differential equations. The two different integration models will then be discussed alongside how we chose to implement these in our experiment.

The results of benchmark and stability tests of the different methods will be discussed together with more general results of how the planets are moving. This is all wrapped up in a conclusion at the end.
