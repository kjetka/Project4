Monte Carlo methods are widely used in both scientific and economic applications. One application is to study the Ising model, where the energy is decided by the configuration of the spins in a lattice. The aim of this project is to simulate a magnetic solid through the Ising model, investigating heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility and critical temperatures at phase transitions. 

This report starts by the describing simplified physics which describes the properties of a Ising solid and Boltzmann statistics. Systems of lattice sizes varying from $ 2\times 2 $ to $ 100 \times 100 $ will be investigated, as well as the properties at the phase transition. The results of benchmark and stability of the algorithm will be discussed.
