In this report we have run simulations of a simplified 2 dimensional Ising model  using Monte Carlo methods and the Metropolis algorithm.  Analytical values for the $ 2\times 2 $ system was calculated, and the mean magnetization, mean energy, heat capacity and susceptibility of lattices up to $ 100 \times 100 $ was estimated. In addition, properties of second order phase transitions was investigated and the critical temperature of an infinite lattice was calculated to be $  2.2777  \frac{k_BT}{J}   $. The systems showed different behaviour at different temperatures, the mean values fluctuating more around the equilibrium at higher temperatures. At the critical temperature, the mean magnetization went to zero. 


Throughout the project I have collaborated with Vilde Mari Johansen in developing the code and figures. This can be found at \href{https://github.com/kjetka/Project4}{Github}.
