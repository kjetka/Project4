OBS: Plot of E, M, Cv, X as functions of T (put L as legend and plot together)

OBS: Indication of phase transition? (Peak - at least for Cv and X)

OBS: Use Equation \ref{eq:critical_T} to extract $T_C$.

def. Cv og X - stigningstall!

Around the critical temperature, both the heat capacity and susceptibility fluctuates a lot. 

Timing parallellisering





Phase transition
As the temperature is increased, the Boltzmann distribution predicts that more states will become stable, lowering the energy necessary to change state of each spin. This can be seen  in figure \ref{fig:4emag} from the fact that $ \langle M \rangle $ approaches 0 after $ T_C $
